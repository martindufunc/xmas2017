# xmas2017

'Twas 2017, some weeks before Christmas. I had this idea... this green ESD mat on my bench infront of me can be fashioned into a Christmas tree cut-out, I can widraw some red LEDs and resistors from the store and I know I have a SAMD10-Xplained-Mini board somewhere...

The project was created in Atmel Studio7 ASF for the ATSAMD10-XMINI board. The pattern sequence and duration is maintained in the transition table, and run within the systick ISR.

Can be pinned to your cubicle wall, good conversation piece. Enjoy!
